# Sea battle Java
This is original 10 x 10 console sea batle game. Maybe code helps you.
Now here is no GUI, but you can play with computer named Vasiliy. Try to destroy Vasiliy ships faster then Vasiliy destroy yours.
Believe me, it's easy, because Vasiliy is stupid a lot.
You can see AI file, it's nothing special, just usual logic for sea battle, without combinations or strategy.
But if Vasiliy will be lucky, you are dead.
Sure that's basic task, but I tried to make it in my way to not see Internet examples. I had fun. (irony)
If you will find my mistakes, especially in OOP and Java approaches.

Updates will come: deep learning, gui, possibility to set your ships by you own (come with gui, now it has no sence), and of course horizontal ship's orientation.
